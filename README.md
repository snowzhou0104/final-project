# ReadMe - Final Project:

 

We decided that we wanted to scope out the best neighborhood that would seem most suitable for a family. We firstly chose to do rate of arrest to determine the neighborhoods with the least amount of crime so it is safe for both children and adults. Secondly, we chose to see which townships had the most amount of playground equipment to conclude which neighborhood was most family friendly. Lastly, we chose public art as our last determining factor of which is the best neighborhood because it will show how developed that neighborhood is for families.
